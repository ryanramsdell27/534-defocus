abstract="This paper describes a real-time stereo vision system that is required to support high-level object based tasks in a tele-operated environment. Stereo vision is computationally expensive, due to having to find corresponding pixels. Correlation is a fast, standard way to solve the correspondence problem. This paper analyses the behaviour of correlation based stereo to find ways to improve its quality while maintaining its real-time suitability. Three methods are suggested. Two of them aim to improve the disparity image especially at depth discontinuities, while one targets the identification of possible errors in general. Results are given on real stereo images with ground truth. A comparison with five standard correlation methods is provided. All proposed algorithms are described in detail and performance issues and optimisation are discussed. Finally, performance results of individual parts of the stereo algorithm are shown, including rectification, filtering andcorrelation using all proposed methods. The implemented system shows that errors of simple stereo correlation, especially in object border regions, can be reduced in real-time using non-specialised computer hardware.",
