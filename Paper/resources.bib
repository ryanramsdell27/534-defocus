abstract="Accommodation cues are measurable properties of an image that are associated with a change in the geometry of the imaging device. To what extent can three-dimensional shape be reconstructed using accommodation cues alone? This question is fundamental to the problem of reconstructing shape from focus (SFF) and shape from defocus (SFD) for applications in inspection, microscopy, image restoration and visualization. We address it by studying the ``observability'' of accommodation cues in an analytical framework that reveals under what conditions shape can be reconstructed from defocused images. We do so in three steps: (1) we characterize the observability of any surface in the presence of a controlled radiance (``weak observability''), (2) we conjecture the existence of a radiance that allows distinguishing any two surfaces (``sufficient excitation'') and (3) we show that in the absence of any prior knowledge on the radiance, two surfaces can be distinguished up to the degree of resolution determined by the complexity of the radiance (``strong observability''). We formulate the problem of reconstructing the shape and radiance of a scene as the minimization of the information divergence between blurred images, and propose an algorithm that is provably convergent and guarantees that the solution is admissible, in the sense of corresponding to a positive radiance and imaging kernel.",

abstract="This paper describes a real-time stereo vision system that is required to support high-level object based tasks in a tele-operated environment. Stereo vision is computationally expensive, due to having to find corresponding pixels. Correlation is a fast, standard way to solve the correspondence problem. This paper analyses the behaviour of correlation based stereo to find ways to improve its quality while maintaining its real-time suitability. Three methods are suggested. Two of them aim to improve the disparity image especially at depth discontinuities, while one targets the identification of possible errors in general. Results are given on real stereo images with ground truth. A comparison with five standard correlation methods is provided. All proposed algorithms are described in detail and performance issues and optimisation are discussed. Finally, performance results of individual parts of the stereo algorithm are shown, including rectification, filtering andcorrelation using all proposed methods. The implemented system shows that errors of simple stereo correlation, especially in object border regions, can be reduced in real-time using non-specialised computer hardware.",

	abstract="Stereo matching is one of the most active research areas in computer vision. While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed, relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms.",
